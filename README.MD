# Arch Linux Installation Scripts

This repository contains two installation scripts to set up an Arch Linux system with either a KDE desktop environment or a Docker server.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have installed a minimal Arch Linux base system. You can follow the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) for instructions.

## Usage

### 1. Arch Linux KDE Desktop

To set up an Arch Linux system with the KDE desktop environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the `install_kde_desktop.sh` script.

2. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and make it executable:

chmod +x install_kde_desktop.sh

3. Run the script:

./install_kde_desktop.sh

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to create a user and set a password.

5. Reboot your system when the script finishes executing.

### 2. Arch Linux Docker Server

To set up an Arch Linux system with a Docker server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the `install_docker_server.sh` script.

2. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and make it executable:

chmod +x install_docker_server.sh

3. Run the script:

./install_docker_server.sh


4. Follow the on-screen prompts to create a user and set a password.

5. Reboot your system when the script finishes executing.

## Customizations

These scripts provide a minimal setup for an Arch Linux KDE desktop and Docker server. You can customize and extend the installation process by modifying the scripts as needed. For more information, refer to the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).
